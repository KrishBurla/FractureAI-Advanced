      'Symptomatic Treatment: Recommend RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) protocol for the first 48-72 hours to manage pain and swelling.',
      'Activity Modification: Advise the patient to avoid strenuous activities involving the injured area until symptoms subside.',
      'Safety Netting: Instruct the patient to return for re-evaluation if pain worsens, persists beyond 5-7 days, or new symptoms develop.'
